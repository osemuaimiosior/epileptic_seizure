# Electrical activity 
"Electrical activity in the brain is recorded as a ‘wave.’ There are many types of brain waves that an EEG records. The basic brain waves are alpha, beta, theta, and delta waves. There are other more complex waves. Each type of brain wave has a normal frequency, height, shape, and location. A person’s age can also determine whether a certain brain wave is normal or not. For example, delta waves are normal in young children. They are not normal for adults who are awake. Your doctor examines each facet of a wave to determine if it is normal or not."
