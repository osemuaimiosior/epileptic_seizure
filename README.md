What is an EEG?
An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test used to evaluate the electrical activity in the brain. Brain cells communicate with each other through electrical impulses. An EEG can be used to help detect potential problems associated with this activity.
An EEG tracks and records brain wave patterns. Small flat metal discs called electrodes are attached to the scalp with wires. The electrodes analyze the electrical impulses in the brain and send signals to a computer that records the results.
The electrical impulses in an EEG recording look like wavy lines with peaks and valleys. These lines allow doctors to quickly assess whether there are abnormal patterns. Any irregularities may be a sign of seizures or other brain disorders.

# Electrical activity 
"Electrical activity in the brain is recorded as a ‘wave.’ There are many types of brain waves that an EEG records. The basic brain waves are alpha, beta, theta, and delta waves. There are other more complex waves. Each type of brain wave has a normal frequency, height, shape, and location. A person’s age can also determine whether a certain brain wave is normal or not. For example, delta waves are normal in young children. They are not normal for adults who are awake. Your doctor examines each facet of a wave to determine if it is normal or not."
